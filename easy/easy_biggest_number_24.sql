-- Question 24
-- Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
-- Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

-- +---+
-- |num|
-- +---+
-- | 8 |
-- | 8 |
-- | 3 |
-- | 3 |
-- | 1 |
-- | 4 |
-- | 5 |
-- | 6 | 
-- For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
-- +---+
-- |num|
-- +---+
-- | 6 |
-- Note:
-- If there is no such number, just output null.

-- Solution
SELECT 
    num
FROM (
    SELECT
        num,
        count(num)
    FROM my_numbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING count(num) = 1
) t;
